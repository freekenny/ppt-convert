ppt-convert
Turn AI-Generated Slide Images into Editable Presentations.

Move beyond static screenshots. ppt-convert is a tool designed to take images of slides generated by AI platforms—such as Google's NotebookLM—and intelligently reconstruct them into fully editable PowerPoint (.pptx) files.

Inspired by the innovation of NotebookLM and the agility of Nanobanana, this tool seamlessly bridges the gap between static AI visual output and dynamic, usable presentation documents.

Why use ppt-convert?
AI tools are fantastic at summarizing data and generating slide layouts as images. However, these images are dead ends—you can't edit the text, move the boxes, or adjust the design.

ppt-convert solves this by using advanced vision AI to analyze the slide image, separate the text from the graphics, and rebuild it as a functional PowerPoint slide.

Key Features
Image-to-Editable Conversion: Stop re-typing text from screenshots. Convert PNG or JPG slide images into editable text boxes and separate visual elements in PowerPoint.

AI-Powered Layout Analysis: Utilizes advanced models (e.g., Gemini Vision) to intelligently understand the structure of the slide, distinguishing between headers, body text, and diagrams.

Smart Reconstruction: Attempts to preserve the original layout, font sizing hierarchy, and alignment of the AI-generated image in the final PPTX output.

Batch Processing: Handle multiple slide images in a PDF in a single run.

Clipboard Support: Capture screenshots directly from clipboard for instant conversion.
